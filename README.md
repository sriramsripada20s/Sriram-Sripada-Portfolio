# Projects

## [Predicting Service Faults On Telecommunications Network Using Machine Learning](https://github.com/sriramsripada20s/Telstra_ML_endtoend_Project)

**Abstract**

Fault severity prediction is a crucial business statistic for telecom providers to create customer advocacy. In this project, we use data mining techniques to predict fault severity at a location. We evaluate various machine learning models based on classification metrics.

**Objective**

To predict Fault Severity at particular time and location based on log data available Fault severity has 3 categories: 0,1,2 (0 meaning no fault, 1 meaning only a few, and 2 meaning many)

**Deployed Streamlit web app on Heroku Cloud created so that users could explore my LGBM Classification model predicting the Telstra network's Fault Severity at a time at a particular location based on the log data available.**

## [Amazon Fine Food Reviews- Python, Text Classification, Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/sriramsripada20s/Amazon_FineFood_Review_Analysis)

**This was a part of my personal project where I worked on Building A NLP Model to Classify the reviews from Amazon**

**Objective:** To classify reviews as positive (Rating of 4 or 5) or negative (rating of 1 or 2) based on the text/reviews provided by various users on Amazon using Machine Learning and Natual Language Processing Techniques

**Amazon Fine Food Reviews Analysis Data Source:** https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews

**How to determine if a review is positive or negative?**

We could use the Score/Rating. A rating of 4 or 5 could be cosnidered a positive review. A review of 1 or 2 could be considered negative. A review of 3 is nuetral and ignored. This is an approximate and proxy way of determining the polarity (positivity/negativity) of a review.
