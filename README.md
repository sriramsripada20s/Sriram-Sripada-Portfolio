# [Project 1: Telstra - Predicting Service Faults On Australia's Largest Telecommunications Network](https://github.com/sriramsripada20s/Telstra_ML_endtoend_Project)

**Abstract**

In the modern era of technology, importantly in the Telecommunication space, the challenge to drive customer advocacy and build a loyal customer base has always been a major challenge for all the telecom providers. Over the years both the network volume and network conditions have changed, service disruptions or service faults have been the important cause for reduction in the number of active users. Identifying fault severity at a certain location and time, has always been a crucial business statistic because the major purpose of organizations is to create consumer advocacy, which helps them save money and retain and better service their customers. In this report we try to predict fault severity at a location using data mining techniques and help organizations detect Service faults. Various machine learning models have been used to predict faults and evaluated based on various classification metrics.

**Objective**

To predict Fault Severity at particular time and location based on log data available Fault severity has 3 categories: 0,1,2 (0 meaning no fault, 1 meaning only a few, and 2 meaning many)
